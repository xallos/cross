cross
=====

A library implemented in various languages (initially PHP and JS) that deals with the everyday tasks (strings, arrays, etc) in a uniform way.

Purpose
-------

All developers have to code in many different programming languages. Each language has it's own commands and capabilities to cope with the everyday tasks the programmer needs. So the developer has to remember each one and all of these oddities in order to code efficiently. Now with this library I aim to cope with the problems above by imlementing exactly the same features in all supported languages.

This library wont be optimized for speed of execution in any way, but aims to minimize the development time. However if you want to contribute to that direction - or in any other - you are **more than welcome**!

Requirements
-------------

Initially **Cross** will be implemented for Javascript and PHP, but hopefully more languages will follow. A language, in order to be suitable for the **Cross** library to be implemented in, must have the following requirements:


* Be Object Oriented in some way
* Implement some kind of callback functions


Roadmap
-------

`v.0.1`

1. Define the API and the configuration options, at least regarding strings
2. Implement this API for Javascript
3. Implement this API for PHP
